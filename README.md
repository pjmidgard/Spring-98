Division 7-65535 bits and 0-31 5 bits

Algorithm: Division plus 1 this and write a bit less or more and multiply by this number back. If prime number -1 and divide. Repeat this many times. The number must be two n like this 2 ** n. E.g.: 7 bits 2 ** 9 and plus the same bits of long of the times: times (2**7)-1. 7-65535 bits. Deep: X + 6 bits. E.g.

Deep: 1

7 bits.
